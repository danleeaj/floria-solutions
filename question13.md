To find the value of \( a \) for the given problem, we need to determine the volume of the solid formed by revolving the region bounded by the curve \( y = x \), the x-axis, and the line \( x = a \) about the y-axis. 

The formula for the volume of a solid of revolution about the y-axis using the shell method is:

\[ V = 2\pi \int_{0}^{a} x f(x) \, dx \]

Here, \( f(x) = x \), so the volume integral becomes:

\[ V = 2\pi \int_{0}^{a} x^2 \, dx \]

Given that the volume \( V \) is \( 18\pi \):

\[ 18\pi = 2\pi \int_{0}^{a} x^2 \, dx \]

Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. **Set up the integral**:
   \[ 18\pi = 2\pi \int_{0}^{a} x^2 \, dx \]

2. **Simplify the equation**:
   \[ 18 = 2 \int_{0}^{a} x^2 \, dx \]

3. **Evaluate the integral**:
   \[ \int_{0}^{a} x^2 \, dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{0}^{a} = \frac{a^3}{3} \]

4. **Substitute the evaluated integral back into the equation**:
   \[ 18 = 2 \left( \frac{a^3}{3} \right) \]

5. **Solve for \( a \)**:
   \[ 18 = \frac{2a^3}{3} \]
   \[ 18 = \frac{2a^3}{3} \]
   \[ 54 = 2a^3 \]
   \[ 27 = a^3 \]
   \[ a = 3 \]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is \( 3 \).

The correct answer is **E. 3**.
