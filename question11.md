Absolutely! Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding Marginal Cost and Total Cost**

* **Marginal cost (C'(x)):** The cost of producing one additional unit.
* **Total cost (C(x)):** The total cost of producing a certain number of units.

To find the total cost from the marginal cost, we need to integrate the marginal cost function.

**1. Integrate the Marginal Cost Function**

Integrate C'(x) = 5 + 0.4x with respect to x:

∫ (5 + 0.4x) dx = 5x + 0.2x² + C 

This gives us the total cost function C(x), where C is the constant of integration.

**2. Find the Constant of Integration**

We don't know the fixed costs (the cost of producing zero sneakers), which is represented by the constant C. However, we can find the cost of producing the first 100 pairs relative to the fixed costs.

**3. Calculate the Cost of the First 100 Pairs**

Evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 100:

∫[0, 100] (5 + 0.4x) dx = [5x + 0.2x²] evaluated from 0 to 100

= (5*100 + 0.2*100²) - (5*0 + 0.2*0²) 
= 500 + 2000 = 2500

**Answer**

The cost of producing the first 100 pairs of sneakers is 2500 (relative to the fixed costs).  So the answer is **A**.
