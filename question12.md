To find the average value of the function \( f \) over the interval \([-1, 6]\), you can use the formula:

\[ \text{Average value} = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx \]

where \( a = -1 \) and \( b = 6 \).

1. **Determine the integral \(\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx\)**: This integral represents the area under the curve \( f(x) \) from \( x = -1 \) to \( x = 6 \). You can split the integral into parts corresponding to the different segments of the graph.

2. **Calculate the area under each segment**:
   - **Segment from \( x = -1 \) to \( x = 0 \)**: This appears to be a right triangle with a base of 1 and a height of 1, giving an area of \( \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 = \frac{1}{2} \).
   - **Segment from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 2 \)**: The area under this semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 \). Here, \( r = 1 \), so the area is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\pi}{2} \).
   - **Segment from \( x = 2 \) to \( x = 3 \)**: This segment is at \( y = 0 \), so the area is 0.
   - **Segment from \( x = 3 \) to \( x = 5 \)**: This rectangle has a base of 2 and a height of 1, giving an area of \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \).
   - **Segment from \( x = 5 \) to \( x = 6 \)**: This is a right triangle with a base of 1 and a height of 1, giving an area of \( \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 = \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Sum the areas**:
   - Total area = \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\pi}{2} + 0 + 2 + \frac{1}{2} \)

4. **Calculate the average value**:
   - The length of the interval \( [a, b] \) is \( b - a = 6 - (-1) = 7 \).
   - Thus, the average value of \( f \) is \( \frac{1}{7} \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\pi}{2} + 2 + \frac{1}{2} \right) \).

Let's calculate these values step-by-step.

The total area under the curve \( f(x) \) from \( x = -1 \) to \( x = 6 \) is approximately \( 4.57 \). The average value of the function \( f \) over the interval \([-1, 6]\) is approximately \( 0.653 \).

This result corresponds to option C:

\[ \frac{5}{7} + \frac{\pi}{14} \approx 0.653 \]

Thus, the correct answer is C.
