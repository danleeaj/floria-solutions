Absolutely! Here's how to find the average value of a function on a given interval using the graph:

**Key Idea:**

The average value of a function on an interval is equal to the definite integral of the function over that interval divided by the length of the interval.

**Formula:**

Average value of f(x) on [a, b] = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a,b] f(x) dx

**Steps:**

1. **Interval:**  We're given the interval [-1, 6].

2. **Definite Integral as Area:** The definite integral ∫[a,b] f(x) dx represents the net signed area under the curve of f(x) between x = a and x = b. We can calculate this area geometrically from the graph by breaking it into simpler shapes.

3. **Calculate Areas:**
   * **Quarter-circle:** Area = (1/4) * π * (1)^2 = π/4
   * **Rectangle (above x-axis):** Area = 2 * 3 = 6
   * **Triangle (above x-axis):** Area = (1/2) * 1 * 2 = 1
   * **Triangle (below x-axis):** Area = (1/2) * 1 * 1 = -1/2 

4. **Total Area:**
   * Total area = (π/4) + 6 + 1 - (1/2) = (π/4) + 13/2

5. **Average Value:**
   * Average value = (1/(6 - (-1))) * ((π/4) + 13/2)
   * Average value = (1/7) * ((π/4) + 13/2)
   * Average value = (π/28) + 13/14

**Answer:**

The average value of f on the interval [-1, 6] is **(π/28) + 13/14**, which corresponds to answer choice **B**.
