Absolutely! Here's how to solve this related rates problem:

**1. Define Variables and Formulas**

* Let  'r' be the radius of the balloon.
* Let 'S' be the surface area of the balloon.
* Let 'V' be the volume of the balloon.
* We know the formulas for the surface area and volume of a sphere:
    *  S = 4πr²
    *  V = (4/3)πr³

**2. Find Rates of Change**

* We are given:
    * dS/dt = 4 * dr/dt  (The rate of change of surface area is four times the rate of change of the radius.)

**3. Differentiate the Formulas**

* Differentiate the surface area formula with respect to time (t):
    * dS/dt = 8πr (dr/dt)
* Differentiate the volume formula with respect to time (t):
    * dV/dt = 4πr² (dr/dt)

**4. Substitute and Solve**

* Substitute the given information (dS/dt = 4 * dr/dt) into the differentiated surface area formula:
    * 4 * dr/dt = 8πr (dr/dt)
* Divide both sides by 4 * dr/dt (since the rate of change of the radius isn't zero):
    * 1 = 2πr
    * r = 1/(2π)

* Substitute this value of 'r' into the differentiated volume formula:
    * dV/dt = 4π (1/(2π))² (dr/dt)
    * dV/dt = dr/dt 

* To find the volume (V), substitute the value of 'r' back into the volume formula:
    * V = (4/3)π (1/(2π))³
    * V = 1/(6π²)

**Answer:**

The volume of the sphere at the given instant is **1/(6π²) cubic units**, which corresponds to answer choice **D**.
