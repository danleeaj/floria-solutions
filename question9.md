Absolutely! Here's how to solve the integral using substitution:

**1. Choose a Substitution**

Let  u = x² + 1 
Then, du = 2x dx

**2. Rewrite the Integral**

Notice that the 2x dx in the integral is exactly our du.  So we can rewrite the integral as:

∫ e^u du

**3. Integrate**

The integral of e^u is simply e^u + C (where C is the constant of integration).

**4. Substitute Back**

Substitute x² + 1 back in for u:

e^(x² + 1) + C

**Answer:**

The correct answer is **B**.
