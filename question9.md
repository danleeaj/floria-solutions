Absolutely! Here's the breakdown of the question and why the correct answer is B:

**Understanding Parallel Tangents**

Parallel tangents on a graph mean that the slopes of the tangent lines at those points are equal. In calculus terms, the slope of the tangent line at a point is the derivative of the function at that point.

**Analyzing the Options**

* **A.** This is incorrect. The negative slopes of parallel lines are equal, but the slopes themselves are opposite.
* **B.** This is correct! If the tangents are parallel, the derivatives (slopes of the tangents) at x=a and x=b must be equal.
* **C.** This is incorrect. This would mean the function has a horizontal tangent everywhere, not just at specific points.
* **D.** This is incorrect. This states the second derivative is equal to the first derivative, which doesn't relate to parallel tangents.
* **E.** This is incorrect. This states the slopes of the tangents are not equal, which is the opposite of what we want for parallel tangents.

**Therefore, the answer is B.**
