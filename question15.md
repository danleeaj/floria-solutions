Absolutely! Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Recognize the Setup**

We're given:

* g'(x) = f(x)  (This means g(x) is an antiderivative of f(x))
* h(x) = x * f(x²)

We want to find the area under the curve h(x) from x = 0 to x = 3. This area is represented by the definite integral:

∫[0, 3] x * f(x²) dx

**2. Use Substitution**

To simplify the integral, let's use substitution:

* Let u = x²
* Then du/dx = 2x  => dx = du/(2x)

Now, substitute into the integral:

∫[0, 3] x * f(x²) dx  =  ∫[0, 9] x * f(u) * (du/(2x))

The x's cancel out:

(1/2) ∫[0, 9] f(u) du

**3. Connect to g(x)**

Since g(x) is an antiderivative of f(x), we know:

∫ f(u) du = g(u) + C

**4. Evaluate the Definite Integral**

Substitute back u = x² and evaluate the definite integral:

(1/2) [g(u)] evaluated from 0 to 9 
= (1/2) [g(9) - g(0)]

**Answer**

The area under the curve h(x) from x = 0 to x = 3 is represented by **(1/2) [g(9) - g(0)]**, which corresponds to answer choice **D**.
