Absolutely! Let's break down this problem step by step:

**A. Find P(t)**

Since the population size, P(t), is the antiderivative of the rate of growth, we need to integrate the rate function:

* **Integrate each term:**
   * ∫200 dt = 200t
   * ∫9√t dt = 9 * (2/3) * t^(3/2) = 6t^(3/2)
   * ∫(-5t) dt = (-5/2) * t²
* **Combine terms and add the constant of integration, C:**
   * P(t) = 200t + 6t^(3/2) - (5/2)t² + C

**B. Find the Constant C**

We're given the initial population P(0) = 2000.  Let's substitute t = 0 into our P(t) equation:

* 2000 = 200(0) + 6(0)^(3/2) - (5/2)(0)² + C
* 2000 = C

**C. Find the Population after t = 4 Hours**

Now that we know C = 2000, our complete population function is:

* P(t) = 200t + 6t^(3/2) - (5/2)t² + 2000

Substitute t = 4 to find the population after 4 hours:

* P(4) = 200(4) + 6(4)^(3/2) - (5/2)(4)² + 2000
* P(4) = 800 + 6(8) - 40 + 2000
* P(4) = 2808

**Answers**

A. P(t) = 200t + 6t^(3/2) - (5/2)t² + C
B. C = 2000
C. P(4) = 2808
