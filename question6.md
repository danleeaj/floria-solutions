Absolutely! Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Find the Second Derivative, y":**

* **Find the first derivative, y':** 
    *  y' = 2.4x - 0.4e^(0.4x)
* **Find the second derivative, y":**
    * y" = 2.4 - 0.16e^(0.4x)

**2. Find the Point of Inflection:**

* **Set the second derivative equal to zero and solve for x:**
    * 0 = 2.4 - 0.16e^(0.4x)
    * 0.16e^(0.4x) = 2.4
    * e^(0.4x) = 15
    * 0.4x = ln(15)
    * x = 2.5 ln(15)

**Answer:**

The function changes concavity at x = 2.5 ln(15), which corresponds to answer choice **D**.
